Hotel Booking Cancellation Project on Excel 

Introduction:

I'm excited to share my Hotel Booking Cancellation project, where I analyzed a dataset from Google to understand booking trends and cancellations in the hotel industry.

Project Overview: 

In this project, I utilized Excel to create a comprehensive dashboard that visualizes booking and cancellation data from 2015 to 2017. Using DAX formulas and Pivot tables, I extracted insights to identify trends across different categories such as single, couple, and family bookings.

Key Learnings:

Built a visualization project in Excel, showcasing booking and cancellation trends over multiple years.
Utilized DAX formulas to analyze data and extract meaningful insights.
Practiced presentation skills by creating an interactive dashboard for easy understanding.

Dashboard Features:

Combined data from multiple years into one sheet for comprehensive analysis.
Used a consistent color palette throughout the dashboard for visual coherence.
Incorporated interactive elements to enhance user experience and engagement.

Presentation Dashboard:

To practice my presentation skills, I created a dynamic presentation dashboard that highlights key findings and insights from the project. Viewers can navigate through different sections to understand the data more effectively.
